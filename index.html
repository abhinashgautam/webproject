    <h2>Few Facts About The World</h2>
           <article id="Earth">
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object 
        known to harbor life. This is made possible by Earth being an ocean world, the only one in the 
        Solar System sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean,
        covering 70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's crust is land, most of which is located in

        the form of continental landmasses within Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is at least somewhat
        humid and covered by vegetation, while large ice sheets at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than
        Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers, and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust consists of slowly moving 
        tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid
        outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.</p></article>

            <li>Earth is the third planet from the Sun</li>
            <li>The existence of water in the liquid phase on Earth is due to the temperature span that exists on the Earth: 0 – 100 degree Celsius</li>
            <li>Earth is the only place in the solar system where water can be present in all the three states – solid, liquid and gas</li>
            <li>We are all traveling around the Sun at an average velocity of 107,182 kilometers per hour</li>
            <li>Earth receives between 100 and 300 metric ton of cosmic dust every day</li>
            <li>In size, Earth is slightly larger than Venus.</li>
            <li> It is also interesting to note that more than 95% of Earth’s ocean are still unexplored.</li>
            <li>Tides in oceans on Earth happen due to the force of gravitation between the Earth and the moon</li>
            <li>Earth has just one moon whereas Jupiter has 67 moons</li>
            <li>The Moon reflects Sun’s light on the Earth</li>
